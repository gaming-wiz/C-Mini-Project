\textbf{Brief Description:}
\newline

We have designed a car rental system which lets the users choose any specific car model to rent.By using Car Rental System, our customers would be able to increase their business. This would help them to connect to the global world instead of limiting their services to the local domain alone.
\newline
This new system has the capability to show car details, user profiles and receive valuable feedback from the user. Customers do not need to waste two three hours to get a car anymore.
\newline
In this car rental system, the user starts off by creating a account and successful logging in enables the user to choose his desired car from a list of car models available. There is no chance of data misuse or loss since additional security measures have been adopted to avoid data breaches.Moreover the registration process is not time-consuming . The user can then specify the number of days he will be using it for, and whether he will be needing a driver or not. Based on the given input, the program will then calculate the fee which the user will be urged to pay by visiting a website (for obvious reasons website is non-functional). The rented car will then be added to the user profile, which the user can view anytime he wants to do so. Additional features like giving special discounts is also present as a part of the system. The user can also give his own feedback as to how the service can be improved and also can give a star based rating on how his or her experience was. This whole project was developed using C programming language and various concepts and features such as file handling concepts(the link to which is added in the references) , pointers , structures etc. were utilized. This program is easy to operate and will be easily understood by the users.
The sole purpose on why this project was developed is to constantly deliver a quality product and friendly service keeping in mind about the cost effectiveness . We are working to increase automation in the system to enhance the users experience with the system.
